# Pockie Ninja Client

This project is the client for PN.

## Public Assets

To prevent long build times due to a large amount of assets the public assets are in another repo pockie-ninja-assets
You will want to create a symlink to these assets in this public folder.

Ex on windows command prompt with admin access:

`mklink /D <PATH>\pockie-ninja\public\assets <PATH>\pockie-ninja-assets\public`

replacing <PATH> with the windows path to those directories.
